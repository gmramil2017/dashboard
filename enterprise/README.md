## Running it

### Front-end

```sh
MB_EDITION=ee yarn build-hot
```

Clear the Webpack cache using `yarn remove-webpack-cache` if you previously ran OSS edition in dev mode to avoid unexpected application behavior.

### Back-end

You need to add the `:ee` alias to the Clojure CLI command to run Dashboard Enterprise Edition.

```clj
# Start a local Dashboard server that includes EE sources
clojure -M:ee:run

# start a REPL that includes EE sources.
clojure -A:ee

# start a REPL that includes EE sources & test namespaces.
clojure -A:dev:ee:ee-dev
```
