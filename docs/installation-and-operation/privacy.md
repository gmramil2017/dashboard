## Do you need a Data Processing Agreement with Dashboard to comply with GDPR?

### Self-hosted

If you self-host your Dashboard instance, we have no access to any of your data, UNLESS you opted in to give us [anonymized usage stats][information-collection]. Even in that case, Dashboard doesn't gather any personally-identifiable data. As such, if you're self-hosting, we are not a data processor for the purposes of GDPR.

### Dashboard Cloud

If you're a [Dashboard Cloud](https://www.metabase.com/pricing) customer, your [Terms of Service](https://www.metabase.com/license/hosting) include a Data Processing Agreement (DPA).
