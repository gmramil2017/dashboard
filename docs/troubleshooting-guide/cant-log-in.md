# People can't log in to Dashboard

## No access to Dashboard login page

If you're not a Dashboard admin, you'll have to tag them for help here.

1. Check that you have the correct [site URL](../configuring-metabase/settings.md) from **Settings** > **Admin settings** > **General**.
3. Check if the [account is deactivated](../people-and-groups/managing.md#deactivating-an-account).

## No access to Dashboard Cloud account

The admin password for `store.metabase.com` (where you can find payment and subscription info) is not necessarily the same as the password for your Dashboard instance (where you log in to look at data).

If you've forgotten your Dashboard Cloud admin password, you can [contact support](https://www.metabase.com/help-premium) to reset the password.
